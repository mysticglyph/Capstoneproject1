#Capstone Project: DevOps Lifecycle Implementation
-------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------

Project Overview
----------------
This project demonstrates the implementation of a complete DevOps Lifecycle for a product-based company called Abode Software. The project focuses on automating the build, test, and deployment processes using various DevOps tools and practices to achieve faster and more reliable software delivery.

Technologies Used
-----------------
- Git: Version control system for managing source code.

- Jenkins: CI/CD tool to automate the build, test, and deployment processes.

- Docker: Containerization tool for packaging the application.

- AWS CodeBuild: Continuous integration service to build and test code changes automatically.

- Ansible: Configuration management tool for automating software installation and system setup.


Project Workflow
-------------------
The project follows a structured Git Workflow with two primary branches:

master:
---------
  The production-ready branch.

develop:
-------
   The development branch for testing and integration.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Git Workflow
------------

master branch:
-------------

Commits to this branch trigger a build and test process. If the tests pass, the code is automatically pushed to production.

develop branch:
--------------

Commits to this branch trigger a build and test process, but the code is not pushed to production.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Key Features
------------

Automated Build and Test: Using Jenkins and AWS CodeBuild, the project automates the build and test processes for both master and develop branches.

Containerization: The application is containerized using Docker to ensure consistent environments across development, testing, and production.

Configuration Management: Ansible is used to automate the installation of necessary software on the servers.
